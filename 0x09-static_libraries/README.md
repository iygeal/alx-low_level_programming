Welcome!

This directory is dedicated to projects on static libraries.

Here we learn how to create static libraries using the ar command, which takes .a (an archive) file format for unix systems. We also learn about indexing the static library files using the ranlib command and list their symbbols using nm/ar commands.

Thank you.
