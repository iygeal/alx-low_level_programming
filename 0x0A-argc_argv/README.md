This directory contains my projects done on the concept of arguments to the main function of C programs. argc, short for argument count, contains the number of arguments passed to the program while running it.

On the other hand, argv, short for argument vector and often written as 'char *argv[]' is a pointer to arrays of pointers, which contains the actual arguments, begining with the program name, passed while running the program.
