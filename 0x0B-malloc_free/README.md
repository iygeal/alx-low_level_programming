Hello and welcome to join me in this project. Here we talk about dynamic memory allocation.
Previously, we have been dealing with memories in static manner. Memories for our variables and functions were automatically allocated to us based on compilers we use and also based on the architecture of our local machines. This is flawed. We can easily use up our system memories if we continue this way.

Enter dynamic memory allocation. With dynamic memory allocation, we literally allocate memories to our variables, dynamically!

We use malloc, calloc, realloc and free functions to manipulate memories this way. There is also valgrind to help to finetune the processes and make sure no memory is lost.

Stay with me.
