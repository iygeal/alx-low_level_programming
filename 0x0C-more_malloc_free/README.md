Welcome once again. We are still dealing with dynamic memory allocation.

In addition to the malloc function, we also make use of calloc function to dynamically allocate memory to our variables in C.

calloc differs from malloc in that it accepts two arguments and allocates uninitialized variables with the value 0 (zero).

We also have another function, realloc. As its name suggests, realloc is used to reallocate memory to a variable. It can be used to increase or decrease already allocated memory.
