Before programs written in C compile, they first go through preprocessing stage. During this stage, directives in the code such as #include, #define, and #if are manipulated before the code is passed to the compiler for compilation.

The preprocessor does not generate assembly code.The compiler is the one that generates assembly code from the preprocessed source code.

Stick with me as I explore the world of Preprocessing in C.
