Welcome once again, to join me in my journey in C programming.

Here I do projects about Structures and typedef.

Structure (struct for short) is a user-defined data type declaration which defines a grouped list of variables under one name in a block of memory. Different variables in a struct can  be accessed through a single pointer or by the struct declared name which returns the same address.

typedef, on the other hand, is used to simply rename or give an alias to an existingd data type.
