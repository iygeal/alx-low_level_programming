Singly Linked Lists
===

A singly linked list is a linear data structure in which the elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations and each element is connected only to its next element using a pointer.

Singly linked list is a better alternative to array in the sense that, provided we have enough system memory, we can assign unlimited elements to a linked list. Also, we can easily remove an element from a linked list.

Each element in a singly linked list is referred to as a node. Each node contains two items: - the first contains data while the second contains a pointer which points to the next element in the list.
